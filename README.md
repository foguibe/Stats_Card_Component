# Project Readme

## Stats Card Component

The Stats Card Component project is a responsive web page created with HTML and CSS, showcasing a range of front-end development skills. This README provides an overview of the project's structure and the developer's proficiency in various areas.

### HTML Structure

The `index.html` file defines the structure of the web page:

1. **Document Structure**: The document adheres to HTML5 standards with essential elements like `<meta>`, `<link>`, and `<title>`.

2. **Semantic Markup**: Proper use of HTML5 elements such as `<main>`, `<div>`, and `<footer>` for structured content.

3. **Responsive Images**: The project utilizes the `<picture>` element for responsive image loading.

### CSS Styling

The `styles.css` file contains CSS rules that style the web page, demonstrating various CSS skills:

1. **Box Sizing**: CSS rules that set `box-sizing` to `border-box` for consistent box models.

2. **Margin Reset**: Default margins are reset to control element spacing.

3. **Typography Enhancements**: Improved typography with custom fonts, text rendering, and responsive font sizes.

4. **Media Handling**: Images are configured for responsiveness with `max-width: 100%`.

5. **Flexbox Layout**: Flexbox is used for layout control, making the content responsive and centered.

6. **Background and Border Styling**: Background colors, border-radius, and box-shadow are applied for aesthetics.

### Specific Styles

- Styling of text elements such as `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<h2>` for a consistent design.

- Custom fonts, colors, and font weights to enhance visual appeal.

- Responsive design techniques for different screen sizes, adjusting layout and styles accordingly.
